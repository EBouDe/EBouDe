- 👋 Hi, I’m @EBouDe, I work at the Amos municipal library's Medialab.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything, but for the purpose of this space : science, technologies, 3D printing, vinyl cutting, Arduino, LittleBits, MakeyMakey, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things, all related to the stuff I'm interested in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on French language resources for Makerspaces
- 📫 How to reach me : medialab(at)amos.quebec
